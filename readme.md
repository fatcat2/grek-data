# grek-data

You ever wanna rank purdue fscl based on stats?

Yeah you can do it here.

This is a Node.JS project hosted on Heroku running with an express.js backend and a React frontend. The datatable used on the front page is [material table][https://material-table.com/#/ ].

To do
* Switch from material table to react-table (sorry material table)
* add posts/comments
* add previous years' data


Note: this project is a personal endeavor for fun
